# Import dictionary with english words
# Get subset of dict with 5 letter words 
# Generate a five letter word 

# Loop 6 times: 
    # Get keyboard input from user 
    # Confirm input is 5 letters
    # Convert input to lowercase/upper case (dependent on dict?)
    # Check if input is a word 
    # Compare user input string to generated string by index 
    # Generate if statement that tells the user inputed entry matches generated word 
    # Break if all correct
